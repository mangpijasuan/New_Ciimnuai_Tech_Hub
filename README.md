## 🛠 Core Projects

### **Phase 1: Foundations (2025-2026)**
These foundational projects focus on language intelligence and cultural preservation, ensuring immediate impact and community engagement.

| **Project**               | **Tech Stack**             | **Status**         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Zomi Neural Translate    | Python, Hugging Face     | 🚧 In Development  |
| Smart Dictionary+        | Flask, TTS APIs         | ✅ Alpha Release   |
| Digital Heritage Archiver | Django, AI tagging      | 🚧 Planning Stage  |

#### **Key Highlights:**
✅ **Zomi Neural Translate** – A transformer-based AI translation model with dialect recognition.  
✅ **Smart Dictionary+** – Context-aware definitions with speech synthesis for pronunciation assistance.  
✅ **Digital Heritage Archiver** – An AI-powered platform to archive Zomi traditions, stories, and historical artifacts.  

### **Phase 2: Growth (2026-2027)**
Once foundational initiatives are established, we expand into revenue-generating solutions and intermediate technologies:

- **AutoDev AI** – Generative AI tools for code generation, documentation, and testing. Target local developers and tech startups.
- **AI Fraud Shield** – Lightweight anomaly detection system for fraud prevention. Partner with local financial institutions to pilot the solution.
- **Quantum Security Demo** – Begin exploring post-quantum cryptography and hybrid quantum-classical machine learning using Qiskit/PennyLane.

### **Phase 3: Scale (2028-2030)**
After achieving financial stability and a strong user base, we tackle ambitious, resource-intensive goals:

- **Quantum AI Lab** – Dedicated lab for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning research, solving complex computational problems relevant to the Zomi community.
- **DeFi/Stablecoin Research** – Exploring decentralized finance solutions for microfinance and remittances, tailored to underserved communities.
- **Global Indigenous Collaborations** – Expanding the platform to empower other indigenous communities worldwide.
